        <p class="leading-12">
          Hey, my name is Chen Brilling. I'm a B.A. student in Psychology in my
          last semester at Bar-Ilan University. During the previous two years,
          I've worked as a research assistant in the Social Neuroscience Lab,
          where I developed a keen interest in creating experiments. As a
          research assistant, I've gained a lot of hands-on experience with
          various tools, including EEG, physiological systems, FFMPEG, OpenPose,
          and experiment creation using PsychoPy, Labvanced, and Qualitrics.
          Until recently, I have also been doing an internship as a Front-End
          Developer in Labvanced, another excellent platform for online
          experiments creation. I have experience with data processing tools,
          including SPSS, Jamovi, and Excel (VBA). I have a broad understanding
          of Javascript and Python and have created many experiments using
          PsychoPy. I also have expertise in editing tools such as Photoshop,
          After Effects, and Illustrator, which always come in handy. And many
          more tools.
