            I offer everything regarding PsychoPy. I can create your experiments
            from scratch, whether online or in person. Give you guidance on how
            to use PsychoPy and understand it better for your academic purposes.
            I will gladly troubleshoot your existing experiments, fix bugs and
            develop new features for you. Feel free to ask me anything regarding
            Psychopy.
